Algorithm - fnDeleteFrom_1D(array,n,k)
Purpose - This algorithm deletes an element from one dimentional array.
Input - array[] is an one dimentional array with n elements. Data at position k needs to be deleted.
Output - The array with n-1 elements.
Pseudo code - 
{
    for(i=k;i<n-1;i++)
        array[i]=array[i+1];
    n=n-1;
}
